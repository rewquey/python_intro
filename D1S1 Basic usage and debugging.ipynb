    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Python crash course for climate scientists. I'm glad you're here. During this course we'll give you an overview of how you can use Python in your projects. No-one can become fluent in Python in three days. Instead, we aim to show you a range of tools, how to use them and how they fit together. When you need to use one of them in your own work you can easily look up its documentation.\n",

    "* Python has risen to [become the most popular programming language in the world](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/). As it turns out [Python is also incredibly uiseful in science](https://developer.ibm.com/dwblog/2018/use-python-for-scientific-research/).\n",

    "For this first sessions we're first going to cover the fundamentals of Python. Next, you'll be given a few small tasks to complete on your own.\n",

    "## Interactive Coding\n",
    "* Most of course will be conducted through interactive coding. This means we write code and you write the same code into your own Notebook.\n",
    "* We'll go quite fast. Don't worry if you don't understand all of it immediately. Afterwards you'll be given a few small problems where you can become more familiar with the concepts we've covered.\n",
