    "# Day 3 - Performant Python\n",
    "* Python has a reputation for being slow. But it's not necessarily true. Today we're going to talk about how to make Python very fast.\n",
    "* This session has two parts. First, we'll learn why Python is slow unless one is careful and how to use numpy and numba to make it go fast.\n",
    "* For the second part we'll give a you a few problems where you can experiment with these tools.\n",
    "* I personally find this very exciting."
